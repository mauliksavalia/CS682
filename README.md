Project 6: Smart Recharging Platform for Drones and Ultracapacitors

Problem Statment: Develop an integrated electro-mechanical system that combines circuitry, electronics, communication, and programming skills to manage and automate the process of exchanging batteries in a drone. The system must be capable of signaling the drone when it is ready to receive a new battery, safely releasing and retrieving the spent battery upon the drone's landing, charging the retrieved battery, and replacing it with a fully charged one.
