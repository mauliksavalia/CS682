*************** Project 6: Smart Recharging Platform for Drones and Ultracapacitors ****************

Problem Statment: Develop an integrated electro-mechanical system that combines circuitry, electronics, communication, and programming skills to manage and automate the process of exchanging batteries in a drone. The system must be capable of signaling the drone when it is ready to receive a new battery, safely releasing and retrieving the spent battery upon the drone's landing, charging the retrieved battery, and replacing it with a fully charged one.

We've developed a unique system for automated drone battery management, integrating piezoelectric pressure sensors, IR sensors, current and voltage sensors, along with machine learning. This system automates battery swapping and charging, ensuring efficient and reliable drone operation.  We're excited to demonstrate how this project works.
